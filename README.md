# Determination of the  optimal wavelength range for photosynthesis in  Leguminosae Plants.

Photosynthesis, the process by which plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis in plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds. 
As we know sun light is a spectrum of different wavelengths. So there must be certain wavelengths that a plant would prefer more. For an example Blue light can contribute to the growth of a plant. This phenomenon is observed clearly in plants rather than grown trees. For a further study in this Leguminosae Plants were chosen.

The Fabaceae or Leguminosae, commonly known as the legume, pea, or bean family, are a large and economically important family of flowering plants. It includes trees, shrubs, and perennial or annual herbaceous plants, which are easily recognized by their fruit (legume) and their compound, stipulate leaves.

# Methodology

▪ Capturing absorption spectrums of White light getting transmitted directly through tender leaves.
▪ Analyzing the absorbance spectrums with various analyses techniques. 
▪ Identifying the peak wave lengths of absorbance and Intensities. 
▪ Capturing absorption spectrums of White light getting transmitted through a Slurry of leaves. 
▪ Analyzing the absorbance spectrums with various analyses techniques. 
▪ Identifying the peak wave lengths of absorbance and Intensities.
▪ Analyzing the peaks of the absorbance spectrums taken from the previous step. 
▪ Determining the percentages of Chlorophyll A, Chlorophyll B, Carotene etc. 
▪ Applying the obtained Pigment data for the analysis of finding the most preferable wavelengths.
